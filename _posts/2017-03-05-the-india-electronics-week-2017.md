I took some time off on Friday to visit the <a
href="https://www.indiaelectronicsweek.com/">India Electronics Week (IEW)</a>.
And it was a wonderful experience to meet up with a whole lot of excited,
purposeful and well-meaning people. This is a small write-up about some of
the people I met and some observations I made. I intend to write in detail
about some of my discussions.

## ProtoCentral

Meeting up with the <a href="https://www.protocentral.com/">ProtoCentral</a>
team was one of the goals I had while visiting the IEW. I wanted to put faces
to names of people I've interacted with and purchased hardware from and even
admired. 

ProtoCentral builds a bunch of Open Source Hardware (OSHW) 
[sensors](https://www.protocentral.com/sensors/1081-pulse-plus-pulse-ox-heart-rate-sensor-based-on-max30102.html)
and [boards](https://www.protocentral.com/biomedical/1114-protocentral-healthypi-hat-v2-for-raspberry-pi.html)
apart from also selling a variety of other hardware. I had purchased the <a
href="https://www.protocentral.com/biomedical/1114-protocentral-healthypi-hat-v2-for-raspberry-pi.html">HealthyPi</a>
board from them a few weeks back. I was extremely impressed to see such a
unique board (its an ECG, respiration and SpO2 measurement board) built as open
source hardware and by a firm based right here in Bangalore. They have their
circuit schematics, PCB Design, firmware and a reference software
implementation <a href="https://github.com/Protocentral/HealthyPi/">available
for use</a> on Github.

I had a very interesting discussion with the ProtoCentral founder,
Ashwin Whitchurch - but more on that in a separate post. For now do check out
their <a href="https://www.protocentral.com">website</a> and Ashwin's <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdhUHpqoymk">presentation at OSHWA
2016</a>.

## SECO

![](/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_20170303_150720.jpg)

Quite a few months back, in my <em>infinite wisdom</em> to acquire yet another
single board computer, I participated in a <a
href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/udoo/udoo-x86-the-most-powerful-maker-board-ever/">Kickstarter
crowdfunding campaign</a> to acquire a unit of the <a
href="http://www.udoo.org/udoo-x86/">Udoo x86</a> board. It had been touted as
the most powerful single board computer (and I still think it is). And so I was
pleasantly surprised to hold the piece in my hands at the <a
href="http://www.seco.com/en/our-story">SECO</a> stall. (<em>Udoo x86 shipments
start <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/udoo/udoo-x86-the-most-powerful-maker-board-ever/posts/1788329"> 
later this month</a>.</em>)

SECO is an Italian company (with an office in
Bangalore) that has designed the Udoo range of single board computers.
(<em>And, of course, I never knew that part of the story. Or how some of this
 engineering was done right here in Bangalore.</em>) Mathan Raj Murugan, who I
met at the SECO stall, was a contributor to the Linux kernel support initiative
for the Udoo x86. It was a pleasure to listen to him explain about this work
and have him showcase the various features of the board first hand.

## In(fiction) Labs

![](/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_20170303_152819.jpg)

I came across <a href="http://www.infictionlabs.com/">Infiction Labs</a> quite
by accident while I was perusing the startups stand in Hall 2 of the
exhibition. Infiction builds a wide range of hardware solutions. They have
undertaken a wide range of turnkey hardware projects over the past few years
that they have been in business. And now, one of the things that they do is
build simple DIY robotics kits. They sell these kits to school children as a
starting point for electronics experiments. What impressed me was their
enthusiasm, transparency and energy.

<a href="http://www.infictionlabs.com/#team-section">Havish and Gurudeep</a>
spent quite some time explaining things to me and seemed very open to
discussion on their design - even though most of the inputs/comments that I had
for them were about things that I felt were either missing from their product
or queries on why they hadn't chosen a specific approach.

Its good that they took all the inputs in a very constructive manner and I look
forward to carrying on a conversation with them in the near future. I did
purchase a simple <a
href="http://www.amazon.in/Infiction-Ultrasound-Obstacle-Detection-Robotic/dp/B018UDL6JW/ref=pd_sbs_21_3?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=1Z5F0HJFED1FTRYDWT45">obstacle
avoidance robot</a> from them and hopefully I'll assemble and test it out real
soon.

## IoT, Cloud and "Big Data" Training

I came across two companies that offered online training courses in the
Internet of Things (IoT), "cloud" concepts and "big data". But I came away
unimpressed by their understanding of their own offerings. Their understanding
of "big data" is limited to Hadoop. Their knowledge of IoT clouds was limited
to what Microsoft Azure seemed to be offering. Their concept of IoT was a
Raspberry Pi and Arduino kit with a set of sensors. Nevertheless, I am sure
that they are helping educate people about these things in their own way. And
irrespective of how impressed I might be, it is still a positive contribution
towards building awareness in general.

## PCB Power

![](/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_20170303_155233.jpg)
  
Over the past year, I had been searching for Indian companies that could help
in PCB prototyping. My focus was on companies with which I could operate
completely online - that is without having to personally send them an email and
follow-up on my requirements... and which had a process to handle enquiries no
matter what the size of the customer or the production volume. And that led me
to <a href="http://www.pcbpower.com/">PCB Power</a>.

After some initial bad experiences getting them to manufacture PCBs for my
personal use, I was able to successfully take their help in building production
quality PCBs that I could sell. Their process for handling of orders has
improved quickly and I am now able to upload PCB designs, get a quotation, make
a payment and then get a confirmation about the production and delivery dates
with ease. Out of all the companies I talked to and approached over the past
year, PCB Power was the only one I had success with. I had some good
conversations with Pavan about my experience of working with them and he was
very receptive to my inputs and feedback. And did I mention that they are based
in Gandhinagar, Gujarat? :)

## Others

Apart from these, I visited a variety of other companies that held my interest:

  * A company called "<a href="http://www.anandspacers.co.in">Anand
  Enterprises</a>" which manufactures washers, spacers and other such mounting
  components <em>(alas - they only supply these in bulk quantities of 500 units
      and above</em>),

  * An electronics parts catalog magazine called <a
  href="http://www.99electronicsworld.com/">99 Electronics World</a>, <em>(I
      bought a subscription - it reminded me of the classifieds in Elektor and
      other such electronics magazines that I used to read with great interest
      as a kid),</em>

  * <a href="http://www.module143.com">Module143</a> - a vendor of a variety of
  boards and components - they had the new <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32">ESP32</a> SoC on display along
  with a breadboard adapter that they have designed for it,

  * A power supply company called <a href="http://www.axionpad.com">Axion
  Energy Conversion</a> - they have multiple configuration of power supplies
  but once again - they only supply in very large quantities (and so my search
      for reliable and high quality power supplies continues),
  
  * <a href="http://www.messungwerksitz.com">Messung Werksitz</a> had a variety
  of furniture for electronics labs and clean rooms; they had ESD chairs and
  height adjustable tables for electronic prototyping with power supplies,
  meters, lighting and more built in.
