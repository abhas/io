In the midst of everything we have to say about DRM-locked music, I thought
services that allow you to purchase DRM-free music should be highlighted. One
way to sensitise people against DRM is to help them access services that can
provide them what they need without the defects of DRM. One such service in
India is the <a href="http://www.saregama.com/musicstore"> SaReGaMa Music
Store</a>.

> SaReGaMa India Ltd., is the custodian of over half of all the music
> ever recorded in India. This makes us the premier Music destination for South
> Asian Music and the most authoritative source of the region's musical heritage.
> Saregama has the largest music archive - and catalogue - in India.

Their music store enables you to purchase music and download them in the MP3
and WAV formats. As far as I can tell, all their content is available without
any DRM or encryption.

On their terms of use page, they say:

> ## Content Usage
>
>  * You are authorised to use the Content only for personal, non-commercial
  use, and you may not redistribute, transfer, assign, sublicense or use the
  content in any other manner whatsoever

  reverse-engineer, circumvent, 'hack', disassemble or otherwise alter or
  interfere with any of the security components related to this website or any
  Content provided through it. Any such security component is an essential part
  of the content and may not be removed without copyright infringement of such
  content.

I personally feel that their terms are fairly standard for anyone selling any
type of content. Audio CDs and printed books ship with similar terms of
service. The second point listed above does refer to "<em>security
components</em>" and implies that DRM may be involved with some of their
content. However, I wasn't able to search for and encounter any such content in
the limited time I spent searching for it.

On the other hand, their downloads are quick and smooth. Their search engine
works well. They enable you search music based on almost any parameter you
would need - including <em>mood</em>.

<p class="caption">I purchased <a href="http://www.saregama.com/album/hum-dono_4279">this
album</a> in the "HD" format - which basically means that they don't compress
the music and provide it to you in the WAV format.<p>

However, selling mainstream music in DRM-free formats is a great start. And if
you care about Indian music, them you will definitely relish this opportunity
to rebuild your digital music library without any DRM-lock music being a part
of it. I sincerely hope more publishers follow their lead.
