subtitle: Are you student intending to participate in a "hackathon"? If what
  you want you are trying to optimise for is learning and challenging yourself,
  here is some advice on how to do that. I also offer suggestions on alternate
  methods of building your project and why it is important to think about some
  of these things.

---

## Background

Many students participate in over-night programming events dubbed "hackathons".
Such events provide a good opportunity for students to try their hand at
solving one problem over a 24 to 36 hour period. However, in a bid to provide a
working solution to the problems they have chosen to work on, students often
resort to using a rather unfair mix of proprietary software, framework and
non-free cloud services. While this does enable them to build something "novel"
very quickly (ie. in the 24 to 36 hour time period reserved for the hackathon),
it does not do much in terms of challenging them or creating deeper learning
opportunities.

At the same time, the rules and constraints of the hackathons themselves are
very broad and generic. The organisers tend to focus more on the encouraging
students to build "seemingly novel" solutions to the problems they are working
on. Focus on using Free Software or GNU/Linux is completely absent as is any
focus on self-hosting the software and hardware infrastructure required to build
the solution. The absence of such a focus means that a valuable opportunity to
convey the value of software freedom to students is lost.

In this essay, I try to examine why students make the sort of technology choices
they make and how, by optimising for convenience and ease-of-use, students miss
out on building better capability and appreciating issues related to online
privacy and software freedom.

## What is a "hackathon"?

I am not sure why such programming and problem-solving contests are called
"*hackathons*", but they are. They are organised by engineering colleges to
encourage students to solve problems and build solutions over a focused 24 to
36 hour time period. Students are required to choose a theme they would be
working on and then provide an abstract of what they are trying to achieve. They
then use the hackathon to actually build a working solution and demonstrate it.

## The problem with "hackathons"

The focus of various hackathons is usually "vertical" in nature - ie. they focus
on specific technology domains or sectors in which students can pitch their
projects. These verticals, such as IoT, machine-learning, socially relevant
solutions and so on don't offer any constraints or guidelines about **how** the
problems must be solved. Hence, students are free to choose the software, the
architecture, the technology stack, the operating system and so on.

This, I feel, is the loss of a great opportunity. In my view, it is not just
enough to come up with novel and innovative solutions to problems. It is not the
"**what**" that is as important, as the "**how**" and "**why**". (In other
words, "**what**" problem a student chooses to solve is not as important to me,
as "**how**" they choose to solve it and "**why**", ie. their reasons for
choosing to solve it.)

While the "**what**" part of the problem-solving might focus on selecting which
problem to solve such that it could be a commendable achievement and which could
be attempted in the 24 to 36 hour time slot, the "**how**" part of the solution
would look at the issues related to the ideology, architecture, licensing,
freedom, privacy and the self-hosted nature of the solution.

Hence, if I am optimising for freedom, learning and control, the "**how**" aspect is
more important for me than the "**what**" aspect. The world is full of extremely
novel and innovative products. But very few of them are built to respect the
freedom of their users. 

What is there to gain by creating more solutions that only add to the body of
proprietary software, hardware and network services that already exist?

## Why do students participate in a "hackathon"?

My observation is that students participate in hackathons for some or all of
the following reasons:

  * They really care about the problems they are proposing to solve and feel
    that the environment of a hackathon will actually enable and motivate them
    to build the solution they want to build

  * They get credit for participating in such events and it would look good on
    their resumes

  * They seek to compete and achieve something in front of their peers

  * They want to test themselves to see if they can build something working in a
    sprint and with limited time

  * The prize money is something to aim for as well!

Dear student, the way I look at it, these goals above don't provide enough long-term value to
a student. It is **not enough to focus on the outcomes**, ie. achieving the
goals of the project or showing that you are capable of building such-and-such
thing. A hackathon is one of the best opportunities to learn and challenge
yourself. The 24-hours that you spend with complete focus, all amenities and no
distractions can help you learn a lot.

Hence, think beyond just building whatever you've set out to build. Aim for
finishing the hackathon with a lot more insight, exposure, awareness and
inspiration than what you came in with. I have some tips how can do exactly this
and more.

## Advice for students participating in hackathons

**Dear Student**, 
  
If you are participating in an upcoming hackathon, please consider
the following points. They might enable you to carve an extremely valuable
learning experience out of the hackathon. Making some (or all) of these choices
will only affect "**how**" you build your project - not what you set out to
build. As a side-effect, you will have chosen a more ethical means of building a
solution - one that does not force the users of that solution to sacrifice their
freedom, choice, control or privacy.

------

### Hack (verb)

Hackathon is a word derived from the verb, *to hack*. So if you're participating
in a hackathon, the first choice you could make is **to hack**. A **hacker**
hacks. You are participating in a hackathon - imbibe the spirit of the [hacker
ethic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic) in your work.

#### Who is a "*hacker*"?

> **Hacker: noun**
> 
> A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and how to
> stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to
> learn only the minimum necessary
> 
> A person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the internal
> workings of a system, computers and computer networks in particular.
> 
> One who programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys programming
> rather than just theorizing about programming.

#### What is the "*hacker ethic*"?

As [Stephen Levy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Levy) summarized in his
book [Hackers: Heroes of the Computer
Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers:_Heroes_of_the_Computer_Revolution)

> Hackers are doers.
>
> They care about doing things.
> 
> They care about access & freedom of information, and
> improvement to quality of life.

If you can understand the hacker ethic and how it has influenced the [free
software movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_movement), you
will be able to understand and adopt the same values into your work and life.

Can you use the hackathon as an opportunity to examine, understand, validate and
adopt the hacker ethic?

------

### Don't focus on convenience!

This advice might seem absurd at first. But let me explain.

While observing the choices that students make during hackathons, I concluded
that most of the choices are aimed at cutting down on the amount of work that
they need to do. This is a strange choice! Why would you, as a student, want to
save work for yourself? Doesn't doing something enable you to understand it
better? By eliminating the need to do even very simple and basic things, are you
also not forgoing the opportunity to learn so much?

For example, at a hackathon I observed that almost 90% of the students chose to
use a cloud-hosted and proprietary database software called "Firebase" for their
database needs! When queried about the reasons, they pointed out how simple it
was to program it from a mobile application or a web application alike. They did
not consider the fact that they were forcing their users' data to be stored on
"somebody else's computer" (ie. the cloud) and the software that was being used
to store this data (ie. the firebase database) was proprietary and out of their
control.

The other 10% of the students used MySQL, Postgres, MongoDB and SQLite for their
database needs and went about setting up and maintaining these databases by
themselves.

------

#### Focus on "doing things yourself"

The problem here is simply that of an excessive focus on "convenience". Using
firebase, for example, might be extremely simple and maybe you integrate it into
your project quickly. But what is it that you learn by using it? How to consume
an API to use proprietary software to store simple data?

Think again. Are you participating in the hackathon to have convenience? Are
you going to stay awake for 20 hours (or more) at a stretch just so that you can
take such short-cuts?

When you do things yourself, you learn so much more and you have so much more in
your control. Plus you don't impose your choice of using proprietary software
onto your users.

------

### Choose self-hosting

The corollary to rejecting convenience is to choose self-hosting. You choose
self-hosting when you build and maintain all aspects of your project yourself.
You host these "aspects" on your own hardware - laptops, single-board
computers, micro-controllers, servers, virtual machines etc.

Choosing to self-host is a *required condition* to choosing free software to
power your project. If you can not self-host a tool, how do you know if that
tool is free/open source software?

#### What can you self-host?

There is always a way to host everything you need yourself. It could be that you
are not aware of such tools or ways of doing things. Can you use the hackathon
to discover ways of self-hosting everything?

You should be able to be build everything you need and hence, control whatever
you have. This includes databases, network services (DNS, DHCP, email, NTP etc),
file services (object storage, block storage, shared file-systems), application
servers, containers, virtual machines, time-series databases, monitoring
systems, wireless networks and so much more.

### Self-hosting in the context of IoT

Usually, an IoT solution consists of the following "layers". You should have
complete control on all these aspects of your solution. The reason I single out
IoT here is because I feel that there is not enough information out there about
how one can build 100% of one's network, cloud-backend and firmware
infrastructure using Free and Open Source Software exclusively.

Consider the following points:

  * **Your hardware and physical setup**

    This includes your micro-controllers, single-board computers, circuits,
    PCBs, serial and network cabling etc.

    Choose your hardware such that you retain the freedom and flexibility you
    require to build your project.

  * **Firmware, programs, source code, network connectivity**
 
    Any hardware you choose should offer two basic freedoms to you:

      * (a) The freedom to program the hardware using GNU/Linux

      * (b) The freedom to compile and execute your programs using a compiler or
      interpreter licensed under a Free/Open Source Software license

    Choose your networking setup such that:

      * (a) you can run the wireless and wired network using your own access
      point to aid control and debugging (extra points for you if you can run
      this access point using a free software operating system such an OpenWRT
      or LibreCMC)

      * (b) you don't have to blame someone else when your program does not work

  * **Metrics storage, analysis and alerts**

    Often tutorials or books that talk about IoT introduce and use proprietary
    software hosted on the public cloud to storage sensor data and metrics.
    Functions related to analysis and alerts, then, are also handled by the same
    set of proprietary software running on the cloud.

    Instead of this, can you choose to use Free Software tools such as InfluxDB,
    Prometheus and OpenHAB to store your sensor data? Can you use a simple
    instance of Grafana to graph and analyse this data? Can you send out alerts
    and detect anomalies using the various features offered by the tools
    mentioned above?

    These are very capable, comprehensive and easy-to-use tools. Don't choose to
    use proprietary software just because that is all that you are aware of. At
    any juncture when you have to make a choice of what software to use for a
    purpose, search and evaluate how you can do it yourself using free software
    tools.

  * **Remote access and control**

    Most IoT solutions that connect to a network (wired or wireless) need the
    ability to remotely access and control the device. Often, the simplest way
    of doing this is to use protocols such as MQTT. The significant value-add
    that is provided by cloud-hosted IoT backends is an effortless way to use
    MQTT.

    However, if you spent some time understanding how MQTT works, you could do
    the entire setup yourself. Using tools such as OpenHAB or Home Assistant,
    you can get ease-of-use while still being able to use free/open source
    software and self-hosting it on a single-board computer (eg. Raspberry Pi)
    or your laptop.

### Can you optimise for learning, instead of delivery?

In my view, the reason students take so many short-cuts during hackathons is
because they are optimising to deliver what they have committed on as the
deliverable for their project. There is nothing wrong in focusing on this -
however, if this focus forces you to take short-cuts and does not create enough
learning opportunities for you, then you are not capturing enough value from the
hackathon!

Instead, my advice is to focus on learning. Whatever you do as a part of
building your project, evaluate how not doing what something "conventionally"
can provide greater learning opportunities to you. Often this learning will
emerge because you use to self-host a Free Software tool for your project or
because you choose to do something yourself.

By focusing on learning, there is a good chance that you will be proud of your
achievement at the end of the hackathon. And this still does not change your
ability to actually deliver on your intended goal - it might just change the way
you deliver it.

### Use a Free Operating System!

I would have thought that in 2018 it would be obvious that students (and
developers) would use GNU/Linux. But my observations suggest the contrary.

When all aspects of your work are actually free software tools, why run them on
a proprietary and non-free operating system? Programming languages such as
Python, Ruby and NodeJS are all licensed under various free software licenses.
Databases that you use, such as MongoDB, SQLite, MariaDB/MySQL and PostgresQL
are also free software tools. Your programming IDEs such as vim, Atom or even
the Arduino IDE are all licensed and available under free software licenses to
you. Arduino libraries and MicroPython (to name a few of the embedded IoT
toolkits) are also free software.

There is a lot more value to derive from these when you run them on GNU/Linux.
While almost all of them are cross-platform and can run easily on Windows or
macOS, I don't see how doing that provides your a better learning opportunity or
an opportunity to get better at doing whatever you're doing.

So use Debian GNU/Linux or Ubuntu or Fedora on your laptops and run all the
tools that you require seamlessly. No need to use virtual machines to run
GNU/Linux just because you want to use Docker to run something in a container.

### Can you choose to build free software?

While it might be too early to think about releasing and sharing your software
publicly, I would actively encourage you to do that. Doing this is not only an
ethical choice to make, but also provides unprecedented learning opportunities.

If you need help to figure out how you can release your project under a Free
Software license and which license you should choose, I would be glad to help
you out.

### Choose free-software on the cloud, not software-as-a-service

This is another way of talking about a point I made earlier. Consuming and using
software offered as a service (eg. database as a service, MQTT as a service,
analytics as a service etc.) is a covert way to use proprietary software. Most
of the times the software that is used to power such services is not available
to you to study, setup, modify or self-host. Additionally, your data is stored
on (and locked-in to) such software-as-a-service offerings and once you use them
for some time, it might be difficult or impossible to leave the platform and
choose something else.

When you *have* to use software that does not run on your computer (ie. software
which is hosted on the "cloud"), ensure that it is free software. This will give
you the freedom and choice that you need in future. Don't choose to use a
software-as-a-service offering just because it is accessible, popular,
free-of-charge or convenient. Making these choices neither offers learning
opportunities to you, nor freedom, privacy and control.

Don't make short-term choices that will remain with you in the long run.

### Reject APIs that deliver convenience at the cost of control and freedom

Using APIs that are backed by proprietary software offered as a service is
another way you compromise on your freedom and learning opportunity. Often an
API is just an easy way to do something that requires no setup and gets you
"productive quickly" and by doing "lesser work".

Thing about this: Is it essential to use an API to build whatever you're
building? Can you do 2% more work and eliminate the API? Can you self-host a
tool and use the API on a network and with software that you have complete
control on? 

How about substituting the API with a protocol?  Eg. A popular way to send an
email is to use a web API offered by a service provider. Instead of using a
proprietary API, can you build a SMTP server on your own to achieve the same
goal? It would be a wonderful excuse to learn how to setup mail services!

APIs are conveniences that can cost us our freedom if we are not careful and
vigilant. Don't make these choices now to deliver something quickly which might
limit what you can do in the future.

### Take the hard way!

Convenience does not facilitate learning, it eliminates it. You should 
optimise for learning. You should welcome problems and challenges because they
present a learning opportunity to you.

> "There is no such thing as a problem without a gift for you in its hands.
> You seek problems because you need their gifts."
> 
> **Richard Bach, "Illusions"**

Take the hard way. Don't avoid problems because you perceive them to be
difficult and an impediment in achieving whatever you've set out to. Problems
that we face when we build something are essential to helping us learn and
become more effective at what we do. All problems - technical, personal,
time-management, collaboration etc - are just indicators of what more we need to
learn.

When you eliminate the problem, you also eliminate the possible lesson associated
with solving it. Is that why you are participating in a hackathon?

The "gift" of a problem is the learning and capability that emerges from
attempting to solve it. The problem is not permanent, the learning is.

### Keep a work diary

Maintain a simple "work diary" to record what you need to work on, what problems
you faced, solutions you considered when trying to solve the problem and
finally, how you solved it. Use this diary to also note down questions that came
to your mind but which you could not answer conclusively right then. If you take
an inventory of such questions, challenges and problems, you can re-visit them
again after the hackathon and continue your learning and study.

Maintaining a work diary is also a good way to reflect upon what you did. It is
not always possible to recollect how we did something or why. A diary would be a
good way to record these things while we are doing them and while they are fresh
in our minds.

Later, you can use this diary to publish an article or a blog-post about "how
you built X"!
