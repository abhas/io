Recently I observed that the process of arriving at a conclusion is far more
important than the conclusion itself. A conclusion, when doled out, is a
recommendation, a best practice and a lesson learned, perhaps after many
trials. It hides, in its finality, all the errors, failures and trials
experienced in the process of arriving at it. And unless someone can really
look behind the conclusion and appreciate the effort involved or the problem
that the conclusion offers a solution for, they might actually not appreciate
the solution as well.

I am handling a training for a department at an engineering college on how to
use simple automation tools and techniques to build, manage and maintain
computer labs. During the course of the initial discussion regarding the
training, I realised that I was offering to solve problems that they had not
yet experienced first hand. I was offering solutions (and hence my conclusions)
on some of the better ways of doing things because they eliminated recurring
problems, made the life of system admins simpler and provided short cuts -
without first having to go through an painful journey interpersed with random
failures and complex challenges.

If they adopted my recommendations they might end up managing their labs
better. But they might not be able to appreciate the simplicity or elegance of
the solution. Or even what it represented. And hence, it is possible that the
solution itself might be lost to them.

How do I make someone value the advantages of automating and scripting
infrastructure setup when they don't really see a problem doing repititive
work? How do I convey the ethic of <em>solving a problem once</em>? [^psna] How do I explain how I arrived at the conclusion
that a specific tool is better to use for its simplicity and effectiveness as
compared to another tool? Or more basically, how do I convey my own ethic of
choosing simple and little tools rather than ones that might be popular,
complex or exhaustive? How does one learn to choose elegance over
complexity? Is this an evolution and a lesson learned - or can it be
taught? Is it a matter of <em>taste</em> or rational choice? How do I provide
instruction on the manner in which someone else might arrive at a similar
conclusion as I did given the same inputs, influences, constraints and
catalysts?

So given that I am essentially pushing my conclusions on others when I impart a
training, how do I make it a fair process of learning to arrive at important
conclusions (and hence adopt a much more useful learning attitude) than just
blindly apply and adopt conclusions made by others? Given the constraints of
time (<em>I have to attempt to teach so much in very short a time frame</em>),
opportunity (<em>what if others don't have the same opportunities as I do or
did which will help them learn and arrive at their own conclusions</em>) and
motiviation (<em>others might not be as interested in learning to learn, ie.
arrive at the conclusion themselves, than just observe the facts and adopt
them</em>).

The last aspect - <em>motivation</em> - is a rather important one. Unless a
person is really motivated to learn a concept well, they will only scrape the
surface enough to get by. I could spend a whole lot of energy outlining a
bottoms-up approach to slowly build a foundation to explain a concept and hence
appreciate the end result. But unless a person finds this process interesting,
it might be lost to them.

These are some open questions. I need to evolve a balance between these two
extremes so that I can attempt to do justice. And so I will write more about
this as I learn.
