## Hi!

I'm Abhas, a hacker, entrepreneur and free software activist. I lead
[DeepRoot GNU/Linux](https://deeproot.in), a Free Software Business and 
[Mostly Harmless](https://mostlyharmless.io), a one-person hardware development
and consulting company.

### About this blog

On this blog, I intend to write about a variety of subjects - most of them
connected to the technology, business and community of free software.

My perspectives mature over time. Sometimes, I can no longer relate to the
manner or content of what I might have written earlier. In those
situations, I would want to write again than go back and change what I
might have written earlier.

Over the past few months, my *urgency* to write has outstripped my
ability to write and hence, my backlog has been growing to an alarming
size. Hopefully, I will be able to do justice to what I need to say.

### About DeepRoot Linux

At **DeepRoot Linux**, we enable organisations of all sizes to use Free Software
for their infrastructure deployments. We provide software, services and
support so that they can use GNU/Linux and Free Software effectively.
Over the past 18 years, we have worked with more than 500 organisations
to help them in their endeavour to adopt and run Free Software. We build
mail servers and mail server clusters, private clouds, containerisation
and automation solution, computer labs and so much more. We provide
support for a variety of free software tools that user's might want to
use and help them implement, scale and secure them.

### About Mostly Harmless

**Mostly Harmless** is a one-person company I started about two years
back to experiment with building and selling hardware that could run
free software in more areas. My goal was also to find new ways of
building products that could respect the user's freedom and privacy.
There are many problems that are often thought to be *somebody else's*
and I decided that I would try to solve as many of them as I could.

### Solitude.io?

This blog used to be hosted on another domain (`solitude.io`) for almost 20 months
before I decided it was time for a change. The thought process with
which I chose the domain and structured the content didn't seem relevant
anymore.

Not that I have outgrown my need for solitude or don't care about
authenticity anymore... its quite the contrary. In a way, its still a
zero-sum game that I want to play for no reason other than the fact that
its worth playing and it is the right thing to do.

### Disclaimers

Here are some of my known biases:

  * I only use, recommend and evaluate things that are free software.
    From my perspective, something is worthwhile, ethical, usable and
    essential only if its free *(as in freedom)*.

  * I value the [hacker ethic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic) 
    above everything.

  * The only reason I buy proprietary hardware or "smart hardware" is to
    break it open so that I can try to learn from it

  * I live a "self-hosted" life. Almost all my computing resources are
    self-hosted - unless I can self-host something and it is free
    software, I don't use it.

  * I only talk about something that I follow myself. Conversely, if I
    say something there are many chances that I would follow it myself.
    If I don't, then I'd be an imposter and you would be doing a great
    thing to point that out.
