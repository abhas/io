subtitle: Unless we are able to choose our hardware carefully, we might run out
  of places to run free software on. Or even the freedom to choose or control
  what the hardware does for us. No wonder you have hardware products that spy
  on us!

For quite some time now, I have become obsessed with using and building
hardware that is hackable. A part of this is my paranoia about using a system
that is a black box (sometimes literally) and another part is about using a
system that I can't open up or fix or study or extend. It's no fun using a
system just as a normal user - without being able to look inside it and learn
from it and basically being a superuser in it.

However, if you go by this logic that any hardware you own should be hackable,
then you're going to end up limiting your choices. Not all hardware is
hackable. Very few hardware designers / manufacturers have any incentive or
motivation to develop open hardware. A lot of hardware suffers from being badly
locked down and impossible to hack. Often the methods employed to deploy
alternative operating systems and firmware are themselves extremely smart hacks - 
sometimes the vulnerabilities of a system are exploited to replace it with
something open, flexible and usable.

So hardware choices have to be made wisely. It all depends on how strongly you
care about this hacker and DIY ethic. This means choosing your laptop, mobile
phone, server, tablet, wireless router, single board computer, keyboard,
digital picture frame, set top box, television and more by using a lot more
decision making than just what is the best possible system that can be
purchased at a given price.

Not just that, there might be compromises to make - sometimes you might end up
buying a costlier product than what you wanted to just make sure that it does
not compromise on your freedom.

You might wonder what is there to gain practically out such hackable hardware.
Well -- apart from a certain pride and peace of mind, there is also a lot of
functionality that you can gain. And in subsequent posts, I will talk
about each hackable / open source hardware that I have built, what it took to
build it and what was to be gained from the whole process.
