<code> https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/opinion/sunday/tyranny-convenience.html </code>

An extremely deep and insightful essay on what convenience is doing to 
us and how "things" that are meant to liberate us via the convenience 
they provide also serve to enslave us with that convenience... so much 
so that:

> ... it is about minimizing the mental resources, the mental exertion, 
> required to choose among the options that express ourselves...  It 
> would be perverse to embrace inconvenience as a general rule. But when 
> we let convenience decide everything, we surrender too much. 

I have long argued that, in the context of Free Software, as long as we 
keep valuing convenience <em>only</em>, we will never seek to value the 
freedom that free software provides us. And in a way, this essay puts 
that exact thought into a much larger and useful context.

Recently while talking to some students at NIT Durgapur, I tried to 
appeal to them to seek problems, to attempt to do more in order to 
create the right opportunity for learning... and how a lot of learning 
is <em> failure-driven </em> (ie. we learn when we fail in an attempt to 
do something). But unless we do attempt to do <em> something </em>, we 
won't fail and hence we won't learn. This was a reference to a trend I 
see where students seek convenience (instead of problems) and my fear 
that it will only create consumers rather than creators and <em> 
hackers </em>.

Hence the author puts it very beautifully when he says:

> Todayâ€™s cult of convenience fails to acknowledge that difficulty is a 
> constitutive feature of human experience. Convenience is all 
> destination and no journey...  if you want to be someone, you cannot 
> allow convenience to be the value that transcends all others. Struggle 
> is not always a problem. Sometimes struggle is a solution. It can be 
> the solution to the question of who you are. 

A lot of times, the degree of freedom we enjoy in our lives is inversely 
proportional to the degree of <em> modern convenience </em> we are ready 
to submit to. I believe that, to start with, we should <em> at least 
</em> be mindful of our choices; we should introspect and understand why 
we choose a particular convenience (or why not).

I invite you to read this article. In a way, it creates the right 
context for using and living a life of software (and technological) 
freedom.
