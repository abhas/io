In an <a href="http://makezine.com/2016/03/04/maker-pro-file-ben-einstein/"
target="_blank">excellent article</a> on the Makezine, Ben Einstein says:

> Make one prototype a week. People forget to build stuff. They get
> caught up in the idea of perfection; they want something to be perfect,
> moldable, beautiful, before anyone uses it. But you donâ€™t need to build
> a fully functional product before you can start getting
> feedback.
