While consuming "<a
href="http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/236036/billy-joel-by-fred-schruers/"><i>Billy
Joel: The Definitive Biography</i></a>", I came across a very interesting
comment by him about keyboards (Joel is a pianist). He says:

> the insurgent energy of rock [music] was well represented by guys pounding at
> keyboards. After all, it's a percussion instrument - you
> <strong>strike</strong> the keys, literally pounding the instrument. It was
> meant to be played hard, like the drums.

This is as relevant when referring to mechanical keyboards. One does pound them
after all. Hard. And the clicky keys make a wonderful, almost musical
percussion sound.<span style="font-size: 16px;">
