subtitle:
  I gave a talk at IoTShow.in the role that Free Software can play in
  building "smart hardware" that respects the freedom of its users. The
  motivation to talk about and address this issue was this -- While we are
  using more software (combined with hardware) than we ever were and
  while we are producing more free software than we ever were, most
  hardware products we build or "own" don't offer us the sort of freedom
  and respect we deserve.
